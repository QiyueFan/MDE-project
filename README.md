# MDE-project
A Model-Driven Engineering project, modeling in EMF, using PetriNet to check whether a self-defined process can end normally (e.g. No deadlock). This is a project I did while studying in ENSEEIHT, France. 

Including:
1. Modeling a "process" -> Meta-model of SimplePDL
2. Modeling PetriNet -> Meta-model of PetriNet
3. Some OCL constraints for both meta-models
4. Using Sirius to visualize the self-defined model based on meta-model
5. Using Xtext to define a DSL (Domain Specific Language) for SimplePDL 
6. M2M (Model to Model) transformation from SimplePDL to PetriNet
7. Using Acceleo to make a M2T (Model to Text) transformation from PetriNet to Tina
8. Using LTL tool inside Tina to do the final checking.
9. An concrete example
